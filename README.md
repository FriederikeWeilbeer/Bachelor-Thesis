# Emotions in Motions: Exploring the Influence of Robot Movements on Human Perception
In this repository the code my bachelor thesis is based on can be found. In the video folder videos of the behaviors can be seen.

The objective of this thesis is to investigate how emotions conveyed through robot
motion influence human perception and emotional state. Using a leader-follower
approach, participants take control of a leading robot and steer the leader along
a predefined path, while a follower robot exhibits different emotionally expres-
sive behaviors. Four distinct movement patterns were designed to represent the
emotions happiness, sadness, anger, and a neutral follow behavior, which served
as a baseline for comparison with the other behaviors.
The happiness motion is characterized by fast and fluid movements with al-
ternating changes in distance between the leader and the follower. The sadness
motion uses a slow sinusoidal trajectory, resulting in an increased distance be-
tween the robots. In contrast, the anger motion reflects assertive, impatient
behavior with close proximity, occasional stops, and potential collisions.
A study was conducted to assess the emotional and time perception of the
robots’ movements. Participants showed nuanced responses, with distinct pat-
terns emerging in emotional engagement, focus distribution, and follower per-
ception, while time perception remained largely unaffected. There were strong
results regarding emotion recognition rates for anger (93%) and moderate recog-
nition rates for happiness (60%) and sadness (33%). In addition, the follower’s
emotional expressions significantly shifted the participants’ focus during the in-
teraction. The follower’s emotional displays shifted attention away from the
leader, with happiness having the most significant effect
